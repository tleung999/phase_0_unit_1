## 6. [Wireframing](6_wireframing/readme.md) Reflection

* * What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

Design thinking is broken up into 4 parts.
1. Defining the problem 
2. Create and Consider options
3. Refine selected direction  (repeat steps 2 and 3 if necessary)
4. Pick the winner and execute. 

Defining the problem is the first step in which you get user feedback and figure out what the core problem that needs to be solved.   Observe the outliers, interview customers/users, understanding the process.  Step two is when you look at all the different options available, think outside the box, you dont always have to do the same thing over and over just because it works.   Step 3 is where you take a handful of options and fine tune them.  Experiment and add modules if necessary.   Give the solution a chance to bloom before scraping it prematurely.   If none of the results work, you might have to go back and repeat step 2 and 3 again.   Lastly, once you have finish prototyping and decided on a winner.   Reallocate resources to the winner and follow through with rigourous testing.

Its was fun building the wireframes for my favorite sites.  It good to see a mock up of how the site can potentially look like before you start coding.    

One question I had was how detailed do our wireframes need to be. Reading through A Beginners Guide to Wireframing gave me some guidance that the basic wireframes should start off with simple boxes describing navigation bars, some titling, company logo, and critical key words.   Large amount of content is unecessary unless you are building a Hi-Definition Wireframe. 

I did not really have any problems with the concept of wireframing.    

Some of the new skills I learned was how to use a wireframe tool. I downloaded Prototyper which is a locally installed application that allows me to build wireframes and save them to an image.

I feel confident with the learning competencies of this challenge.

The part of the challenge I enjoy was dissecting my favorite website and breaking it down into generic blocks to see how each section flows and directs a user to the important part of the page.      

It was quite tedious when I was using the wireframing software to align everything correctly and evenly.    Luckily Prototyper allows you to manually enter pixel width of each box which made it a little easier to keep the same dimensions of each section, but keeping the spacing between each box, and evenly distributing them was tediuos.
