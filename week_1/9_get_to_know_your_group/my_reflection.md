Hi Everyone!

I hope you are all doing well and enjoying your first week in Phase 0.    I’m working through exercise 7 and I’ve been instructed to send you all an email about me.   Listed below is the information I need to provide.

Name: Tony Leung
Location: San Francisco
Favorite Websites: SFGate, Ebay, Craigslist, Facebook, iFixit, Amazon.   
Learning Style:  I am a Multimodal type learner.   Based on my VARK questionnaire, I was pretty even between all 4 strategies.   I was leaning a little bit more toward Kinesthetic than the other 3 which I can understand since I am really into the hands on approach to solving problems.   I like to see things in action, such as someone showing me how to build a Linux box running Apache using PostgreSQL.    It could be in person or via video.     

Have a great weekend and I look forward to getting to know you all better.

Cheers,
Tony

Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.
