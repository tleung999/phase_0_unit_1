Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I enjoyed building my blog and researching and seeing other blog sites to get an idea of what a blog site should contain.   I have not gotten any comments or views yet.   The blog was helpful in my learning since it took me a few hours to position and align my page properly to build out my template.   Answering all the questions for each site was a little cumbersome, but I hope my blog isnt too long winded.   I felt really good about building my template and being able to reuse it again later.   I wanted to add in some social media links but it looks like that will come up when we work on Javascript.
