## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Two new things I learned about the web are the following.
	1. The Internet is different than the World Wide Web.   The internet is a system of interconnected computer networks using a set of standard protocols to talk to one another.
	2. A web site is a set of static web pages that isnt updated often while a web application is dynamic in which it is always changing and updated based on your interaction.

Some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site is that you should have a domain name setup, the domain name is your address that is listed on a DNS server which will provide the ip address of your web server.    If you do not have a domain name setup, you will have to rely on using an ip address to directly access your website.   On last thing you need is a web browser to translate your HTML tags to a format you can easily read and understand.

It was great to see my web page live.   I didnt realize you can directly link to GitHub using (Username).github.io.  I thought GitHub only stores your repository and you'll have to move the files to another web server to host your files.

My aha moment was using Sublime Text 2 to work on my reflection. Also one other thing I noticed is on Sublime is that my package control installer was missing. I researched online and was told to simply reboot my system and package control will appear again. I rebooted and package control did function properly afterwards.
