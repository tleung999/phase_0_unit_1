## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

To create a new repository use the following steps below.
  1. Log into your GitHub account.
  2. Once you log in you'll most likely be on the Contribution tab, click on the Repository tab next to Contribution.
  3. On the upper right hand corner you'll see a green button with "New" labeled.   Click the new button.
  4. You'll now see a new repository creation page.  For owner, you'll see you name next you see a "/" and a blank field.      Enter a new repository name in the blank field.
  5. Enter a description to describe your new repository.
  6. Select Public or Private to allow others to see or not see your repository.  Private repositories are not free by the      way.
  7. Check the box if you want to include a README file for users to see.
  8. There are two drop downs.   Select .gitignore if you want to exclude files you do not want Git to track.   These          files could be log files, temp files, or anything you dont want to share.
  9. Finally the last drop down, add a license.   Select Add a license if you want to specify any copyright licensing.        Such as GPL (General Public License) or MIT License for example.   
  10. To complete the repository creation click on "Create Repository".

To clone a repository use the follow steps below.
  Before you start, make sure you have the GitHub client installed.   For Windows (https://windows.github.com/).   For      Macs (https://mac.github.com/)
    1. Once you have Github installed, link the GitHub client to your account that you created on GitHub.
    2. On your GitHub client screen, you will see This Computer and GitHub.com.   Click on GitHub.com.   
    3. You will now see a list of repositories you created on GitHub.com.
    4. Click on the button "Clone to computer"
    5. A window will pop up and ask you where to save it.   Select a directory name and where to save the repository.
    6. The repository is now cloned to your desktop.

Open Source - Is a practice in which the original source code is freely available to distribute, use, and modify.

I have mixed feelings when it comes to Open Source.    I can understand that open source generates collaboration and the freedom to redistribute the original source code to allow quicker enhancements to the original code, but it doesnt always means better enchancements.    If we lived in a world where money didnt matter, then open source should be the way to develop all types of software.    But I cant imagine Apple, Adobe, Microsoft, and other heavy hitting software company openly sharing their source code with the world.  The corporate world is highly protective of their intellectual property.

Licenses are important in that they protect the creator of the software as well as the person reusing the software.   I think of it as a set of defined rules on how you can use the software, who has permisson to use it, whether you can redistribute it, whether you can make a profit from it, and what license do you need to include if you use it.  The license can help protect  the author from being liable for damages the code causes to another system.

This challenge was pretty straight forward.    I had a great time setting up a repository on GitHub and pulling it down locally using the GitHub client.    I know we'll be moving to the command line version later and that will be a little more challenging since you need to know all the commands and switches.   My aha moment was simply seeing the syncing and the software in action.
