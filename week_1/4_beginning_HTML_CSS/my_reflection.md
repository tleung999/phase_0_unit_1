## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

In HTML it makes sense why it is the structure of the website while CSS is the presentation.    HTML builds the skeletal structure of website by specifying what text are paragraphs, heading type, list type, bold, etc.   CSS lets you design the content types with color, font type, backgrounds, hovers, etc.  In the beginning, it didnt seem to make sense why standalone tags didnt have closing tags. But after realizing it cant contain any text, I can see why you just open the tag with <, fill out the attributes and values, and just end it with />

Well one thing good for sure about HTML is that with HTML5 your doctype is just <!DOCTYPE html> vs the older doctypes such as 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">.    Its also good that in HTML you can nest your tags so that you can start off being really general such as determining the body of the content, then you branch down deeper and call an unordered list, then deeper to the list item itself, and in the list item you have text that is a hyperlink.   I cant really think of anything bad about HTML.

My aha moment is realizing how nice HTML and CSS works together.  When I was building web pages in the 90s, I didnt use CSS and had to manipulate the positioning of contents by laying out a bunch of tables, using no borders, and populating the table with content.  Its now so much easier since I can use CSS to position content, float content, and change inline and block styles.   

I've been using http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp to look up attributes of tags.
