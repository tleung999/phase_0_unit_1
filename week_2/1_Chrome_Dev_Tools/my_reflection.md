* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It provides a structured representation of the document and it defines a way that the structure can be accessed from programs so that they can change the document structure, style and content.  It basically enables us to create fun, interactive, and dynamic websites.   It makes sense to me since each HTML element is an object within the document. You can tree down the document to trigger events, adjust properties, or call methods.  What seems questionable is if all the browser creators such as IE, Firefox, Chrome support all the DOM calls.  From what I read online is that it has gotten a lot better from when it was first created.
