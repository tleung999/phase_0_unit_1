My Website url: tleung999.github.io

* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

In design it is important not to simply just take other web site solution or material and apply it to yours.  You need to take the time to figure out the underline problem.   What does your client want to present to the user and what functionality would they like to see.   You should follow these six steps to design.

1. Information Gathering - Purpose, Goals, Target Audience, Content.
2. Planning - Develop a site map, decide on technology.
3. Design - Whats the target audience? Communicate about likes and dislike of the design
4. Development - The actual coding and implementing features begins.  Build the home page and create a shell.   
5. Testing and Delivery - Final details, testing functionality, SEO, and submit for final approval.   FTP site to server.
6. Maintenance - Continous improvement of the site by adding content via the developer or using a CMS (Content Management System).

In user experience or UX is based on how a person feels when interfacing with the system you built.  When a user uses the system, the following questions would run through their mind.

1. Does the website give me value?
2. Is it easy to use?
3. Is it pleasant to use?

User experience is also focus on user centered design which means that design decisions should be based off the needs and wants of users.   If a user found the site you created was hard to use, they will never come back no matter how flashy or beautiful your site looks.   

I really enjoyed working on my new site.   Some of the CSS was pretty frustrating since I have multiple containers and I had to figure out which is the correct container to manipulate.    Having a wireframe is great since it always gives me a birds eye view of the end product.   

My process to build my site was really straight forward.  I used the following steps.

1. Build your wireframe.
2. Collect all necessary assets such as images, location of fonts, which icon fonts to use, and select a color scheme.   
3. Start building the html file structure using HTML5 semantic tags.
4. Build the layout using CSS. 
5. Once template is complete, add in responsive design layouts.   
6. Test full layout by resizing browser.
7. Once template is finalized, copy template to all necessary blogs and pages.
8. Makes sure all links work.
9. Go get a drink.

Everything seemed to have worked pretty well.  I spent most of my time working on the CSS which is still tricky sometimes.

If I had more time, I think the next thing I would change is building a sticky footer.   I tried getting a sticky footer to work, but I did not have any luck this time around.    But I intend to get it to work right.    I almost got it working when I tried using position:fixed, but it kept the footer on the screen the whole time and blocked some of the content.

HTML5 and responsive design was pretty easy to apply.   The positioning of element using CSS was a little tricky.    It took quite a bit of trial and error before I got some of my elements placed correctly.   

I did find looking at other people's sites inspirational and cool.   It was fun looking at elements they had that stood out and I wanted to apply that to my page.   Also using Adobe Kuler is soooooo awesome!   Its so much fun seeing other people color palatte and you can also favorite them.    I used it to pick the colors for my site.   I initially picked one that was dark blue, green and white, but then I realized that was too close to the Seattle Seahawks color and being a Bay Area native, I would be in deep trouble for picking that :).   So I ended up with another set of colors.
