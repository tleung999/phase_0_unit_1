# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My biggest time management challenge is keeping a balance between taking care of my son being a stay at home dad and studying whenever I have time.   My current technique right now is chip at the mountain one stone at a time.   For every weekly assignment, whenever I had some free time say when my son is down for his nap, I would spend that time studying.   Also when both my sons are asleep around 8pm, I would start studying right when they go down.   

Some of the techniques that I will try is using the Fogg Method to do tiny habits.   I will focus on each piece of the challenge and strive to get through them in a set amount of time.   I will try not to look at the whole week of work as whole. This will keep things from becoming overwhelming.   

I will also take my work and break them up into 25 mins blocks using the pomodoro technique.   During the 25 mins, I will make sure I dont get distracted from anything such as Facebook, reading the news, and watching TV.   I also feel that once I can work through 25 mins straight without feeling like I need a distraction, I will increase the time to larger blocks.   

I am also willing to mindfully find my zone.   I will keep make sure that the challenge given to me is in the goldilock zone.   If its too hard, I will break it down into easier smaller steps and ask someone for help.  It can be either through office hours, connecting with a tutor, or asking my cohort through the community.   If its too easy, I will add additional personal challenges to keep things exciting.

One last thing that I do now and intend to continue doing is not continue to hammer at a problem if I get stuck.   I can take a break, go for a walk, take a shower, or do some chores.   During the break, it helps to clear and reset my mind, and almost every time, I come up with solution that works when I start up again.   

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to learn as much as I can before going into Phase 1.   But I am making sure to learn without impacting my mental and physical health.   Sleep is important and it helps to keep my focus strong.   I also want to make time to network with my peers and learn from them.   Working with them and teaching each other will help solidify the learning process.
