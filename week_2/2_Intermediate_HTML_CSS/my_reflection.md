# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I think that having web standards is an excellent way of unifying the way we structure our web pages/sites.    With each new standards recommended by the W3C starting at HTML, CSS, Javascript, DOM, and now HTML5, building site are more semantically correct and much more dynamic.   

The standard structure starts with a DOCTYPE tag which describes the version of HTML, a HTML tag surrounding everything, inside the HTML tag, a head tag which contains your header information and a body tag which is the actual content.   It makes sense to me simply because the tags start off really generic or general.  The HTML tag is basically the whole HTML document.  Inside the HTML document, we have header information and body content information.   From there the header can hold meta data, title, links to other files, and scripts.   The body tag can have heading types, ordered and unordered list, paragraphs, and links.   Either way, we go from something really general to something more and more specific.

I really like the new HTML5 elements a lot.   Having a header, footer, section, article, and nav tag can really help cut down on the amount of divs you need to create.  Semantic elements help give clarity to where things are placed on the screen and it make the html file more readable.   

CSS Reset is important in removing inconsistent margins, paddings, line-heights, and other attributes that can cause your web pages to look differently across various browsers.

I've mainly used Chrome and Safari and things seem to look the same for both.  I've heard IE is the browser that has more inconsistency from the rest.   I also used to use Firefox, but its was unstable on one of my PCs so I switched to Chrome and never looked back.  I think it is bad that different browser has the possibility of producing a different look of your site.  Not only do you now need to build your pages to work with different devices that has different resolutions, you also have to deal with making sure everything looks good on all popular browsers.
