/*
Pseudocode
Create an array containing an even number of elements in the array
Create an array contain an odd number of elements in the array
Sort both arrays from lowest to highest

Create a sum function that will take in an array of numbers and output the sum
(To calculate the sum take the array of numbers and add them all together)
Check the sum function to make sure its a function
Declare a new instance of sum and see if sum is an instance of it.

Create a sum function that will take in an array of numbers and output the mean.
(To calculate the mean take the sum and divide by the number of items in the group)
Check the mean function to make sure its a function
Declare a new instance of mean and see if mean is an instance of it.

Create a median function that will take in an array of numbers and output the median.
(To calculate the median, determine if the array has an add number of element or even number of elements
if the number of elements is odd, then the median is the middle number of the group, 
if the number of elements is even, then the median is the middle two numbers divided by two.)
Check the median function to make sure its a function
Declare a new instance of mean and see if mean is an instance of it.
