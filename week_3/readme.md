# Introduction to JavaScript

**Please do not do any of the challenges in Week 3. They are in the process of being updated.**

<!-- JavaScript is known as the "language of the web." It is a powerful object-oriented language (Ruby is as well). It is light-weight and can communicate with the browser. This week, we will introduce you to basic JavaScript syntax. The goal is not to teach you JavaScript, rather, we want you to feel comfortable with simple variables and functions. 

You will not begin using JavaScript until Phase 2 in Dev Bootcamp, but don't worry if you feel like you will forget everything. You will have the chance to review in the last two weeks of Phase 0 and the weekend before you begin Phase 2. Moreover, professional programmers look up information and syntax all the time. They don't have everything memorized either, so think of this as an introduction. The more you use JavaScript the more you will remember. For our purposes here, we want you to learn basics so that you can easily re-learn them later. 

## Before you begin:
- [Install Node.js](reading_material/install_node.md)
- Read about [JavaScript 'Object' Objects](http://www.sitepoint.com/back-to-basics-javascript-object-syntax/) Understanding this well will be very beneficial.
- You may choose to read through [JavaScript Reading Material](reading_material) before starting the challenges.

## Submitting your work

You'll continue working in the `phase_0_unit_1` repository this week. 
Check that there haven't been any updates to the original repository by fetching from Devbootcamp's master repo.
- If you are doing this from the Github Desktop App, follow [these](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11394349/upstream-pulls-with-the-github-desktop-client
)
directions. 
- If you are doing it from the command line, follow [these](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork) directions.

You need to submit your work through [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1BpSPJJR8CcC46CKIZum575Q8OefaDZzCDETgRtZ4B-Q/viewform) by Sunday at 11:59pm. Expect to submit your links for each challenge above. 

## Remember your Unit Goals!
- Pair at least once this week with a member of your accountability group.  *You need to pair 3 times on your own this unit*
- Give feedback for each person you paired with. *You need to submit at least 5 pieces of feedback in this unit*
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. *You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit*
